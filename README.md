# Pokemon Battle - Pygame Project

This is a first project on pygame to test limits. Currently features a 1v1 battle system with no animations for moves.
Health Bar with animation, and logs to check prio, damage dealt, KO and more ...

## Plans and Roadmap

See my development plans in the [todo.txt](todo.txt) file.
Also need to use database for move, pokemon stats and everything instead o hard code ;)
